# Seems like investments is the most granular table in this model. Each company must have
# at least one or more investors participating in at least one funding round.
#
# Companies may or may not acquire other companies (which could happen many times), and they 
# may or may not be acquired (which only happens once).
# 
# Companies may or may not have an IPO.
